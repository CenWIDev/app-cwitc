In today’s tech scene, we hear this word used everywhere but do you really feel part of one? For the past decade I’ve spent over 10k hours fostering and developing different communities. Some small, and some large efforts such as THAT Conference but what I’ve come to learn is what I’m here to share.\n\nBeing part of a community is easy, being present and active is something completely different. Many will sign up but won’t even bother showing up, The networks, the opportunities, the support are all right in front of you but you have to take the step, that second step. I’ll explain today’s landscape, explore a few techniques, and help you take that second step.",

You're constantly asking yourself: \"Which technology stack is going to keep me employed?\"\n\nAs a developer, I love chasing shiny new technologies, but over the years I've learned that making my users happy is way more fulfilling than using the latest technology. After over a decade of building software, I've learned the key to good software is getting the boring stuff right.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about why you should spend more time working on evergreen skills. These include skills like creating maintainable code, learning how to learn, and building the right thing. You'll learn what skills have maximum impact and how to improve them. You'll learn how to plan your personal education and make the most of your time. After this talk, you'll be able to sort through the morass of new technologies and make the most of your limited time.",

It was invite only, then Prime only, then finally available for everyone the next summer. Only, most people didn't really seem to care. What does it even do? Why should I bother? Can't I just use my phone?\n\nFast forward to 2018, and it seems like everyone at least knows the Echo, and probably the Google Home. People know how to use them and why you'd have one. The question now has become \"Which one should I get?\" rather than \"Why would I ever buy that?\"\n\nWe've hit the point where people can reasonably expect skills to be on both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. Both devices are in enough houses where it's worth the investment to create skills and actions for each platform. Luckily, this isn't nearly as difficult as it may seem.\n\nWe'll walk through the creation of both Alexa Skills and Actions on Google, look at the differences (there are a few, mostly names), look at what's the same, and see just how we can build a single application to serve both smart assistants. By the end of the session, we'll have a sample application running on both platforms from a single set of REST endpoints.",

You may choose this method because it is easy and it checks off the proverbial box, but employees gain very little from this type of self-paced learning. During this session, I will be describing authentic learning activities that use CTFs (Capture the Flag) events to engage and motivate students. Furthermore, you will walk away with a new perspective on how to get employees to naturally think critically about security.",

We ran into typical implementation challenges and organizational impediments.\n\nAround 2012, my passion for lean, agile, and continuous improvement grew. I left my traditional business analyst and project manager roles behind and evolved into an internal change agent kickstarting an agile transformation.

Or spend hours chasing down NullPointerExceptions in your Java app? Enter Kotlin, JetBrains' new(ish) free, open-source programming language that targets the JVM. This means you can use it everywhere you use Java, but with a modern, succinct syntax.\n\nFor native Android developers, Kotlin is not only available, but it's now considered a first-class language. You're able to write an app completely with Kotlin, or switch over entire components, or even just change your models to Kotlin's data classes (which removes a TON of boilerplate code.)\n\nOh, and for anyone using Java elsewhere, you can add in Kotlin code to your existing application. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, meaning all your existing code/libraries/tests will work with any Kotlin code you write.\n\nDoing JavaScript development? Kotlin can be transpiled into ES5, and there are even libraries available to use React or Angular with Kotlin.\n\nC# dev working on any kind of Java project? You'll feel much more at home with Kotlin, given features like nullable types, properties (rather than getters/setters), and extension methods.\n\nWe'll walk through Kotlin's features, check out the syntax, and even create a small Android application so you can see Kotlin in action.",
