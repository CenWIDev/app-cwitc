In today’s tech scene, we hear this word used everywhere but do you really feel part of one? For the past decade I’ve spent over 10k hours fostering and developing different communities. Some small, and some large efforts such as THAT Conference but what I’ve come to learn is what I’m here to share.\n\nBeing part of a community is easy, being present and active is something completely different. Many will sign up but won’t even bother showing up, The networks, the opportunities, the support are all right in front of you but you have to take the step, that second step. I’ll explain today’s landscape, explore a few techniques, and help you take that second step.",
