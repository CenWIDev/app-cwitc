      "Abstract": "Community, is a word we started using at the start of the 14th century, as a way to define a set of common people. In today’s tech scene, we hear this word used everywhere but do you really feel part of one? For the past decade I’ve spent over 10k hours fostering and developing different communities. Some small, and some large efforts such as THAT Conference but what I’ve come to learn is what I’m here to share.\n\nBeing part of a community is easy, being present and active is something completely different. Many will sign up but won’t even bother showing up, The networks, the opportunities, the support are all right in front of you but you have to take the step, that second step. I’ll explain today’s landscape, explore a few techniques, and help you take that second step.",

      "Abstract": "Technology is a treadmill. Every year, there's a pile of shiny new things to learn. It's impossible to keep up with all of it. You're constantly asking yourself: \"Which technology stack is going to keep me employed?\"\n\nAs a developer, I love chasing shiny new technologies, but over the years I've learned that making my users happy is way more fulfilling than using the latest technology. After over a decade of building software, I've learned the key to good software is getting the boring stuff right.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about why you should spend more time working on evergreen skills. These include skills like creating maintainable code, learning how to learn, and building the right thing. You'll learn what skills have maximum impact and how to improve them. You'll learn how to plan your personal education and make the most of your time. After this talk, you'll be able to sort through the morass of new technologies and make the most of your limited time.",

      "Abstract": "Let's develop an Action/Skill for Google and Alexa in one neat little package.\n\nRemember when the Echo was made available back in late 2014? It was invite only, then Prime only, then finally available for everyone the next summer. Only, most people didn't really seem to care. What does it even do? Why should I bother? Can't I just use my phone?\n\nFast forward to 2018, and it seems like everyone at least knows the Echo, and probably the Google Home. People know how to use them and why you'd have one. The question now has become \"Which one should I get?\" rather than \"Why would I ever buy that?\"\n\nWe've hit the point where people can reasonably expect skills to be on both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. Both devices are in enough houses where it's worth the investment to create skills and actions for each platform. Luckily, this isn't nearly as difficult as it may seem.\n\nWe'll walk through the creation of both Alexa Skills and Actions on Google, look at the differences (there are a few, mostly names), look at what's the same, and see just how we can build a single application to serve both smart assistants. By the end of the session, we'll have a sample application running on both platforms from a single set of REST endpoints.",

These trainings typically require you to answer multiple choice questions, listen to some boring lecture, and then get a participation certificate. Do employees remember anything from these \"trainings\"? The answer is no, they don't. You may choose this method because it is easy and it checks off the proverbial box, but employees gain very little from this type of self-paced learning. During this session, I will be describing authentic learning activities that use CTFs (Capture the Flag) events to engage and motivate students. Furthermore, you will walk away with a new perspective on how to get employees to naturally think critically about security.",
