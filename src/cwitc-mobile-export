First, we’ll discuss temporal tables, which provide a convenient way to track all of the changes made to data in a table.  Second, we’ll talk about the JSON support built into SQL Server 2016 and what capabilities it provides us.  Finally, we’ll talk about the windowing functions in SQL Server, which provide powerful analytic capabilities to use against our data.

    "Abstract" : "Human testing is an important part of everyday software building. To support your QA person or team, maybe your developers hard coded some things and they’re using precious development time changing them around every few weeks. Or, after the 50th time setting up the same conditions to test a relatively small part of your application, you might be asking yourself if there’s a better way to do it. Using tools like Postmaster, Telerik Test Studio, or Selenium, you can add automation to save time and nerves on your project. Automation can also be a great opportunity for development and QA to collaborate. We’ll take a look at: when automation is appropriate, how you can integrate it into your regular testing practices and/or regression testing, how to code for test automation, and Telerik’s coded steps.",

    "Abstract" : "The Google Home, Google's smart speaker, was released last October to some fanfare, a number of jokes (Yes, it kind of looks like an air freshener), and a severe lack of customization.  This finally improved a few months later once the Actions SDK was introduced, allowing developers and companies to create their own actions. Things get really interesting, though, once you start looking at api.ai.  This natural language interaction site allows users to create all the Intents (Tie user requests to actions), Entities (Objects used by your action), and configure integrations needed to create a Google Home action.  You can control what happens whenever users say certain expressions, how intents tie together, and even which pieces of data you want to grab from a user's statement. In this session, we'll walk through what api.ai has to offer, how you can use it to configure all the interaction points for a user, and even how you can integrate with external web services.  Combined with the ability to quickly set up your Google Home action settings (and even use the same logic for other integrations), you'll be up and running on your Home in no time!",

Even after hours of research and contact with the user, you are left with nothing more than a blurry screenshot of \"Object reference not set to instance of object\" and no idea where to go next.  Even if you are successful at designing your application to be robust and maintainable, the wrong error can sideline you for days while you track down a mystery.  If we put all this thought and effort into making our code work well, why not spend some time thinking about when it breaks? Great design isn't only reserved for code that actually works.  In this talk we'll admit to ourselves that we aren't perfect developers, and face the truth that eventually our code is going to break.  We'll talk about how to make sure we have the right resources to solve the problem when it happens.  We'll go over some design strategies that will make sure errors are as clear and informative as possible.  We'll talk about defensive coding and how to handle other developers' errors.
